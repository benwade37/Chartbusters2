## **Description**

Chartbusters is a higher or lower music song quiz game that challenges users to guess whether the next song's chart position is higher or lower than the current song. This interactive and fun game allows users to test their knowledge of music chart history. Aimed at people aged 8 and above, the game is designed to be accessible and enjoyable for a wide range of audiences. The simple yet engaging concept makes it easy for younger players to grasp while still providing a challenge for older music enthusiasts.

Have you ever had a friendly argument with a friend about whether a song made it to No1 or not? Or even in the top ten? Well then this could be the game for you.

## **Project Board and User Stories**

In line with Agile methodology, we wrote user stories in the planning and development of our website. The full details of these can be found on our project board.

## **Wireframes**

Before starting the project, a couple of basic wireframes were created to visualise the final product. Both mobile and desktop wireframes were developed.

## **How AI Was Used**

Artificial Intelligence played a significant role in the development of this project. Here are some ways AI was utilised:

- **Code Generation**

  - AI tools like GitHub Copilot were used to generate code snippets for various parts of the website. This included HTML structure and CSS styling. The AI provided context-aware suggestions that helped streamline the coding process and reduce development time.

- **Debugging**

  - AI-powered debugging tools were utilised to identify and fix issues in the code. These tools analysed the codebase, detected potential bugs, and provided recommendations for resolving them. This ensured a smoother development process and a more robust final product.

- **Accessibility Improvements**
  - AI was used to analyse the website's accessibility features.

By leveraging AI, the project was able to achieve a higher level of efficiency, creativity, and accessibility.

## **Features**

### **Existing Features**

The website includes several features, which are detailed below.

**Colour Palette:**

By using bright neon blue and pink colours, the quiz game creates an appealing, dynamic, and user-friendly experience that encourages engagement and enjoyment. These vibrant colours not only make the game visually attractive but also help in creating a lively and energetic atmosphere that keeps users entertained.

**Responsive Design:**

The website is responsive and works seamlessly on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This ensures that users have a consistent and enjoyable experience regardless of the device they are using. The responsive design adapts to different screen sizes and orientations, providing optimal usability and accessibility.

**Game Intro and Instructions Accordion:**

The game intro features a visually appealing logo and a prominent "Start Game" button to attract users and encourage them to start the quiz. The logo represents the theme of the game, while the "Start Game" button provides a clear call-to-action, making it easy for users to begin playing. This introductory section sets the tone for the game and enhances the overall user experience by providing an engaging and inviting entry point.

Using two accordion features help to reduce space used by the instructions and the large selection of years, making the interface cleaner and more user-friendly. This feature allows users to easily access the information they need without overwhelming them with too much content at once. The accordion design enhances the overall user experience by keeping the interface organised and intuitive.

**Interactive Quiz:**

Users can play the higher, lower, or the same music song quiz, which is the core feature of the website. During the quiz, users are presented with buttons to choose whether the next song's chart position is higher, lower, or the same as the current song. 

During the quiz, users can view the cover image of the current song, along with the song title and artist name. This feature enhances the user experience by providing visual and contextual information about the song being played. Additionally, users can listen to a short audio clip of the song, which helps them make an informed guess about its chart position.

This combination of visual and audio elements makes the quiz more engaging and interactive, allowing users to immerse themselves in the music and enjoy a richer gaming experience.

**Real-time Feedback and Score Tracking:**

The game tracks the user's score in real-time and displays it at the end of the quiz, providing immediate feedback. This feature allows users to see their progress and performance instantly, motivating them to improve their scores and continue playing. Real-time feedback enhances the gaming experience by making it more interactive and rewarding.

**Results and Social Sharing:**

Users can share their scores on social media platforms, adding a social element to the game and encouraging competition among friends. This feature not only increases user engagement but also helps in promoting the game to a wider audience. Social sharing makes the game more interactive and fun by allowing users to connect and compete with others.

  - Allow users to customize the appearance of the game with different themes and color schemes.

### **Technologies Used**

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## **Testing**
The website underwent comprehensive testing to ensure its functionality and accessibility:

- **Manual Code Review:** Conducted to identify and fix bugs, and to ensure accessibility requirements such as alt text on images are met.
- **W3C Validation:** The site was checked using the W3C HTML and CSS validators to ensure compliance with web standards.
- **Link Testing:** Verified that all links work correctly and that external links open in a new tab.
- **Local Testing:** Manually tested the site locally for rendering issues, image loading, navigation links, responsiveness at different breakpoints, and checked the console for errors using developer tools.
- **Hosted Site Testing:** Manually tested the deployed site to ensure it functions as expected.
- **Lighthouse Testing:** Used Dev Tools Lighthouse to assess performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO.

These steps ensured a robust and user-friendly final product.

### **Code Validation**

All HTML and CSS code was validated using the W3C Markup Validation Service and W3C CSS Validation Service, respectively. The results are as follows:

**HTML Validation:**

All HTML code was validated using the W3C Markup Validation Service to ensure it meets web standards and best practices. The validation process helped identify six errors which were easily corrected, resulting in a clean and compliant HTML structure.
